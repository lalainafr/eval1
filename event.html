            The activities initially  covered bringing back to school dropout children with a potential whose single parents were too poor to pay for their school fees. Then it extended to looking after street children, providing them with lunch, clothes and school supplies.  Access to education seems impossible for them. Myriame holds a Bible school in her small yard for some 80 poor children in her suburb every Saturday except on the holidays after which they are provided a small brunch made up of rice with little fish and milk diluted with tea and Malagasy pancake. But over the years, Myriame  addressed providing care and a monthly pension support to elderly people left by themselves and forced to work at an advanced age to earn their living. She provides them with a token pension and some foodstuff every month.

            Myriame engaged in helping out urban young people from destitute families but with a potential, go to private universities.  Also the majority of the people helped out are single mothers or battered women left stranded with many children to feed and the Lord laid the burden on her heart to help pastors, national and international missionaries, and an orphanage.

            Myriame initially focused her help essentially on destitute people, mainly street children and abused children. Later on, she has extended it on children from remote rural communities who have no access to education and those who can manage to continue at the university but have to cope by themselves in town to get a degree.

            Also many battered women or abandoned by husbands with their children are provided support in terms of finance and help to get their children to school at the beginning of each school year. Some women belong to an association of embroiderers whose work is either sold in supermarkets or exported.  Last but not least, vulnerable elderly people are also looked after.

            Besides,  when Myriame can spot young people with a potential who had to  drop out of the education system she provides them with every possible support for them to graduate so that they can in turn help another destitute fellow student until he graduates later thus causing a domino effect within underprivileged communities.
