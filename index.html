          <p>Myriame has been doing her activities for over 30 years now, reaching out to approximately 3000 children at least. She started with the grand grandparents of the current kids, then looked after their grandparents, their parents and them now. They get married at 18 and give birth to children at an early age. Out of these numerous children, 6 could make it. Tahiana, the first one the Lord  put on Myriame’s way is now  a civil servant with a high position at the Ministry of Education, he got a Master’s degree in Management. Another one Haingo has majored in Management also. One, Aina got his master’s  degree in communication. Hoby is now an IT engineer. Angeline is now a midwife. Narindra has got a degree but is still carrying on to become a diplomat. </p>
          <p>Amazing God doing amazing things in His time! The majority of the former children do menial jobs now but the seed, the Word of God is in them and will never return void to Him.  Some who have become scoundrels jeer at Myriame or look down on her when they meet in the streets but she knows God is in control and His angels are around her and her family and  His blood constantly  protects them.</p>
