            <p>Myriame the founder of MY SHALOM was the initiator of the whole project back in 1984. She had just divorced from her husband after 14 years of abuse and ill treatment on herself and their three sons Jocelyn, Jackie and Lalaina. They moved to the current place where she is living now, a neighborhood where the majority of people live in poverty.  She had compassion on children who were forced to drop out of school because their parents could not pay for their school fees any more and helped them. Initially , Myriame just did it without deep concern for the people helped. She started with Tahiana, a little boy of 8 a son of a mother who has other children from different  partners.</p>

            <p> But over the years as she had to bring up her own children by herself , her eyes were opened on the extent of the misery and the needs around her. In the meantime, being an English teacher, she was appointed by her pastor to interpret for English speaking visitors and missionaries. In 1988 their congregation received a couple of pastors Reverend Michael and Pauline MEWIS from Shipley in Great Britain,  who had been at the same theological college as Myriame’s pastor. As usual she was their interpreter and the couple was greatly impressed by Myriame’s commitment and dedication. When time came for them to leave Madagascar, they told Myriame that they came to Madagascar only on the spur of the Holy Spirit that they would see something over there and she was that “thing”. So they left promising her to make her come to UK. Back to Shipley, Reverend Michael Mewis and his wife Pauline spoke to 60 United Reformed Churches in the UK talking about their trip in Madagascar and their intention to make Myriame come over to UK. The funds raised were ready by 1989, but Myriame could go to Great Britain only in 1990.</p>  
            <p>Myriame left Madagascar for the very first time in her life and was warmly welcomed. She came back from UK with a donation £500.00  from all the congregations who received her. Back to the country, she used it helping the poor and destitute kids in her neighborhood without thinking of reporting to the people in the UK. Now the congregation of Reverend Michael and Pauline MEWIS kept on sending her £ 100.00 on a regular basis at Christmas. At the same time, another couple of Reverends Audrey and Alan EVANS  that she met during her visit also sent her $20.00 on a yearly basis to support  her ministry. Myriame realized how huge her responsibility was and she started to report to her benefactors and bring her own input. The support from the URC in the UK has never stopped  increasing over the years shifting first from £100.00 per year to  £ 500.00. Some time  it came up to £ 2250.00, a couple of chaplain in the USA, Steve and Pat BLAISDELL also brought their contribution standing at  $ 3192.00 some time provided on a punctual basis . So these donations in addition to Myriame’s own contribution have kept the ministry going for 32 years now.</p>

            <p>Myriame is an expert to the Courts of Madagascar in English, French and Malagasy. The court is just a platform but she is a vendor to UN organizations, the World Bank, the British and American embassies in Madagascar and a multitude of large NGOs in Madagascar.</p> 
            <p>Whatever she makes fuels her ministry for the glory of God alone. Her daughter Mahandritiana (Tiana)  who is also a translator and interpreter is also deeply involved in injecting whatever she makes into the ministry too.  </p>  
            <p>Together, Myriame and Mahandritiana buy an average of 25 Bibles per month, the final objective being to distribute 2 Bibles per day. The Bible they share is a lovely combination of the Malagasy and English Bibles on one page. People are eager to study English now and it is very helpful as they learn English through God’s Word</p>
